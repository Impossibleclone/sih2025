# Wipe Tool

A secure data wiping application with a Go backend and Tauri frontend.

if you don't know how to install tauri v2 look at the [Tauri Docs](https://v2.tauri.app/start/create-project/#manual-setup-tauri-cli) or something

This project provides a **desktop application** for secure disk and partition wiping.  
It combines a **Go backend** (device operations) with a **Tauri + Node.js frontend** (cross-platform UI).

**Warning:** This tool performs **irreversible data destruction**.  
Use at your own risk. Always double-check the selected device before running.

## Features
- Cross-platform UI built with **Tauri**.
- Backend written in **Go** for direct disk operations.
- Planned support for both **HDD (overwrite methods)** and **SSD/NVMe (secure erase / blkdiscard)**.
- Extensible architecture for adding new wiping algorithms.


## Supported Platforms
- **Linux** (primary target)
- **macOS** (limited â€” some commands differ)
- **Windows** (planned, not stable yet)

> **Note:** Device handling is Linux-oriented (`/dev/sdX`, `/dev/nvmeXnY`). Other platforms may not work properly yet.
